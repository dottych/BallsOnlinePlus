Time's ticking.
Actually, this is around seven times larger.
Huh? Who said balls?
Balls? You bet!
Did you know? All balls have color!
What? A player?
Look who came today!
And the password?
I think that's you...
Use the arrow keys to go woo!
Bet your ID is 69420e... no? Oh..
Don't move and you'll be OK!
What the... That can't be!
0.1 + 0.2 = A disaster!
Beware of your surroundings!
But why is that not working?
The CIA is coming for you!
I'm eating rice...

HTML means "Hello there, mega lurker!"
Watch out! The floor is infected with balls!
Your computer will detonate itself in 3...
Calc.exe helped me count everything!
The meaning of life is...
Do I have to say the words?
Never gonna give you up!
Don't worry, it was just a dream.
Do you think so?
Run!
Yes or no?
This is not a MOTD.
Seriously?
You decide whether you will read this.
Now you stay here forever!
This place is so spooky, literally.
I AM NOT A SKELETON!
I sense a ball...
Behind you!
This is surely a ten out of ten!
Hop on!
New phone, who this?
Draw by holding shift!
We need a disco lurker.
Day 1e+42, still no balls.

You're playing Babs Olin!
But where's Balls Online Minus?
Can we add more balls?
Have you heard of Babs Olin?
Don't press ALT+F4.
Don't touch the liquid!
I warned you.
Balls Offline? What's that?
Someone told me you should press the D button!
If you say "rice" in chat, you will see the creator!
Do you even fact check anything?
Developers, developers, developers!
The new UI update is so great. Wait, is there one?
What the hell's going on, can someone tell me please?
Boo! Did I scare you?
I'm not sure if you are innocent. Vinnocent?
Crazy? I was crazy once.
Balls? I play Balls Online. Online? I'm always offline. Offline? I experience that often, so I create balls. Balls?
I love making references to obscure things. And non obscure things of course.
Some of these messages are getting really long, won't lie.
This happened just by sheer luck!
What do you prefer? Triangles, or spheres?
FIRE! FIRE!
Babs Olin? Seems like a joke to me. Or is it?
Have you heard of Balls Online Minus?
"Can I get Balls Offline?" "No, we have Balls Online."
Help me. Get me out of this message. Please.
Two hours without power, seems like the most boring experience ever.
Three kilobytes of data you sent...? WE ARE SHUTTING YOU DOWN.
Are you into balls? We are as well!
It's hard to think of sentences.
Ever had this one dream where Balls Online just didn't exist? Nightmare.
Did you know: Balls use echolocation. Yeah.
I would put a troll face here, but there's no unicode for that.

Dots?
I suck at texturing. Really.
There's a secret command. Find it.
Go up, go up, go down, go down, go left, go right, go left, go right, press B then A.
Woah, Ballington City!
Everything suddenly makes sense.
I lost track of time. Now it's all strange.
It's so dark out there. Better stay here.
Have you heard of 9933?
Quit Balls Offline, start playing Balls Online. Oh, that's what you're doing.
Every number has a meaning. You'll understand later.
I love texture packs!
All the colours want me to eat flavoured food. Really!
I know what you're thinking, and you're not insane. I saw it too.
Ask your local 8ball about your sanity!
Wait, let me get some chips.
Back with the chips!
I'm going to eat the chips!
The chips are tasty!
How many balls have I seen today?
Today, everything feels strange.
